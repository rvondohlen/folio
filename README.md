## Background

This was initially created as an image collection tool for moodboards and style reference. Given the simple organizational structure, it could work reasonably well as a small portfolio site. 

The main problem I was solving for was having a system that allowed for sharing and easy viewing, but also the ability to have the image files on hand for use later.

a Dropbox folder with tagging and a better view
a Pinterest or Niice collection with image files readily available
